<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites.

<p>Step area is 1.5 times larger with lower step height than fellow forklifts. The hydraulic pallet truck is very rigid, rugged and can take continuous heavy punishment in abusive Indian conditions. When looking at the forks, check for cracks, bends, and distortion that might have happened to due repeated overloading or ramming of loads. At Westminster Lift Truck Services, we always recommend that with the money needed for buying a new forklift, you can buy more used forklifts to improve your workforce productivity and have the budget for minor maintenance.</p>
