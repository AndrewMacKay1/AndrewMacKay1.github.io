<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments.

An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
