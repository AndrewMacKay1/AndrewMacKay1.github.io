<p>The larger models use a telescoping boom with lift capacities up to 10,000 pounds (4,540 kg), vertical reaches up to 40 feet (12 m) and forward reaches of 25 feet (7 m) or more. Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application. The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination.</p>
<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks.
