<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Travelling and manoeuvring with the machine safely over a range of terrains, including steep inclines and undulating surfaces. Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.
