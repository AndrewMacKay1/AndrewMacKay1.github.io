<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>
