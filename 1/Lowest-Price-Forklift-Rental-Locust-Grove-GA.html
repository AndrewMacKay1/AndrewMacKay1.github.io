<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. If your employer deems this certification to be sufficient enough to operate the forklift safely and properly, they will grant you a license. The top supplying country or region is China, which supply 100% of all terrain forklifts respectively.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, we work hard to offer some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame.

<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>The latest user interface concept of these order pickers features a right-hand control unit designed for comfortable, precise operation and a Midi steering wheel on which the left hand rests.
