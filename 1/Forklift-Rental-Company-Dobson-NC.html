<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA. Built to lift boats in and out of tall storage racks while coping with the corrosive nature of seawater, marina forklifts are over-sized lifts with long, rubber-coated forks.</p>

Founded in 1987 as a sales and service provider for materials handling equipment, Lift West Limited is now part of the Dunstall Holdings Group. Dimensioning devices - fork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design. The good news is you don't need to have any experience of driving a forklift truck to start learning with an accredited training provider. Our entire range of electric order pickers is characterised by extremely robust construction. The new products offer advances in efficiency technology with their optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking.</p>

<h3>Forklifts And More Dobson NC</h3>
<p>Whether you need a forklift for just a day, or a fleet of them for months, we'll negotiate a deal that works best for you. We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler. Adding to this, growth in sectors such as retail, FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) and pharmaceutical industries will boost the Pallet Trucks demand, especially in developing parts of the globe.</p>
<p>The dealer insures the equipment, but you or your company must cover the operator, other workers and the facility itself in case of an injury or property damage when using the rented forklift. Our forklifts are ready for immediate pickup or delivery. While lift kits can certainly increase utility, function and style for many truck owners, there are a few safety issues to consider first.</p>
<p>Most counterbalanced forklifts have a three-point suspension system, meaning that the truck is supported at the two front wheels and the center of the steer axle. Roll Pallet Trucks are suitable for handling paper, textile, polymer, carpets and other rolls upto 2000 kgs.

<p>The load could also fall off or cause the forklift to tip. Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. We rent counterbalance forklifts, rough terrain forklifts, high-reach telehandlers, 360 degree rotating telehandler forklifts , electric and manual pallet jack forklifts by the day, week, month, or longer. Discover how today's lift trucks and batteries are revolutionizing the way companies operate for tomorrow.</p>
<p>With FLC's training, they'll learn how to properly and safely drive both regular and three-wheel counterbalance lifts, maneuver their way through tight spaces, properly handle and travel with heavy loads and avoid collisions, falling objects and other types of accidents. Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs. If it is not meant for roller chain pulleys then forklifts would require much taller cylinders to lift up the load to an equivalent height.</p>
