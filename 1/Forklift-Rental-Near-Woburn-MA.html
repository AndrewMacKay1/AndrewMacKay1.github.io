<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires â€” powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>
