<h3>Forklift Operator Job Description Trenton MO 64683</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>If you're based in California, Ahern Rentals is a great place to look into. Available in two main configurations, internal combustion (IC) and electric, standard forklifts represent the greatest potential for weight capacity - with the deck stacked heavily in favor of IC lifts. Reach trucks are the most common and are frequently used on shelves that have simple levels for a single load.</p>
