<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv. A little bigger than a 5,000 lb. truck, the 6,000 lb. electric 4-wheel has a different frame and larger battery compartment. Trade Machines offers a wide selection of used machinery, including all types of forklifts. From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget.

Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>

If your truck is lifted, or if you're getting ready to have a lift kit installed, make sure you're aware of all the potential safety and handling implications that are associated with the additional height and hardware.
