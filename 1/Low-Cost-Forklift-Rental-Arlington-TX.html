This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life.

While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
