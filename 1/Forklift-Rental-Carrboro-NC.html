Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>

Using the procedure outlined for this test an empty truck with the forks elevated to the maximum height should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 percent or 18 percent slope depending on whether the truck has single, rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>

The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required.
