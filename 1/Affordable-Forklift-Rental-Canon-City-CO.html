<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability.

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
