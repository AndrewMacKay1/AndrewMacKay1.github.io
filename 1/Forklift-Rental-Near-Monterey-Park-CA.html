Many lifted truck stores put lifts on high mile trucks, and this can lead to a poor ride and other issues that are associated with lifted vehicles. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

<p>In most cases a reach forklift operator sits sideways but there are some forklifts which accommodate a standing operator.
