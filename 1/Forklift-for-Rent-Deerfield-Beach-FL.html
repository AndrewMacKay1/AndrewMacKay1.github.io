<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>

If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further. Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are most optimal for outdoor construction and surfaces with difficult terrain. Forklifts are powered by electric battery or combustion engines. Today, rough terrain forklifts are a common sight on construction projects. Another safety feature that an electric reach stacker offers is an emergency reversing device in the handle.
