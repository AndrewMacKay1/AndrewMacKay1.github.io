<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots.

<h3>Walk Behind Forklift Poplarville MS</h3>

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.

Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>We have a wide range of indoor and outdoor lift trucks. Powered pallet jacks: These jacks contain an electric motor which assists the user in lifting and moving heavier and even stacked pallets. Efficiently handle bulky, delicate and odd-sized loads with our specially equipped orderpickers - in your choice of 24 volt or 36 volt power units to match your application.</p>
