On new forklifts we offer up to 72 months of either a $1 buyout or a True FMV lease option. Cushion-tired lifts tend to ride lower to the ground than pneumatic-tired forklifts, making this type of forklift well-suited to low-clearance situations. Different types of tyres are available for forklifts. According to a TICO representative, the materials handling equipment market as a whole continued to expand globally due mainly to increases in unit sales in Europe and North America as well as a recovery in China, although unit sales in Japan were on par with the previous fiscal year.</p>

Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. The AC motors that power order pickers deliver smooth controllable power for speedy operation and precise control, without the expensive cost of diesel fuel.</p>
