<p>Decrease speed at all corners, sound horn and watch the swing of both the rear of the lift truck and the load. On the other hand, they can be less stable when turning with loads and have a limited capacity range. Reach trucks are categorized as Class 2 lift trucks in material handling. This class of forklift is one of the most common, and what ones tend to picture when thinking of a forklift's appearance.</p>
