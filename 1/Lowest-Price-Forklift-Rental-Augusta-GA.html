<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida.

The electric pallet jack is motorised and thus provides for faster operation. With the test load elevated to maximum height, without change in the original 19 load overhang dimensions, the test platform should be titled to a minimum of 4 percent, without overturning the truck.</p>
