Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>

Furthermore, technical innovations in reach trucks are anticipated to drive the growth of the market in the coming years.</p>

However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Great customer service, I highly recommend the team at Damoli Forklifts. Lift Capacity: 2000 lbs.
