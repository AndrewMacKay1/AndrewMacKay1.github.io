Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>

Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
