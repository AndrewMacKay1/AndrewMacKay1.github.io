When you choose Thompson Lift Truck as your forklift dealership, you can always count on quality. That is what we have taken that out of the equation for you, with our delivery service for all new machinery and forklift rentals in our range.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Professional installation of suspension lift kits by Rough Country and BDS. For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking. If these tests are used to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities, use appropriate loads and load centers instead of those herein specified.</p>

<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9‚Äù wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process.

<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast.
