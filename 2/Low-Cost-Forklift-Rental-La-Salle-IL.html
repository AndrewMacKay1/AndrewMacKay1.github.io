If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.
