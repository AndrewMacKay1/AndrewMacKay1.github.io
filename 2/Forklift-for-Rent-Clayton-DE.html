Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>

OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years.
