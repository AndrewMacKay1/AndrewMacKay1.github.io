<p>Widely demanded by various industries like textile, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and warehouse, we provideÂ ForkliftsÂ onÂ RentalÂ basis. The order picker's multi-function control handle incorporates a solid base for a secure grip, providing precise control of travel and lifting functions. Overhead Guard = A framework above the operator's head attached to a lift truck to protect an operator. Forklift rental is by far the most flexible and cost effective way to ensure your warehouse operation or distribution center is fully equipped during high volume periods, eliminating bottlenecks and productivity losses.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs. The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>

<p>We provide good condition usedforklift. All of our rough terrain forklifts incorporate designs & features that make our products stand out from the competition.

Lifts come with a maximum lift height of 22 ft. and a ground level lift capacity of 8,000 lb.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.

A pallet jack, also known as a pallet truck, 1 pallet pump, pump truck, scooter, dog, 1 or jigger 1 is a tool used to lift and move pallets Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forklift 2 and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.</p>

The BT Levio W-series of powered pallet trucks consists of six truck models, including the compact LWE130 for more light-duty applications.</p>
<p>These trucks are designed to lift the operator to retrieve items. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight.
