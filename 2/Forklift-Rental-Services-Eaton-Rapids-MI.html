<h3>Forklift Industry Eaton Rapids MI</h3>
<p>A simple phone call to Sun Equipment will initiate a discovery phone conversation where they will share their hands on knowledge of the business and guide you to the right used forklift for your needs. These trucks are great for loading and unloading pallets and balanced materials, well as removing and transporting items from delivery vehicles. Sometimes, your business might require a lift truck that can handle rough terrain and work outdoors.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
<p>Free Lift = The vertical distance the forks can be raised before a mast begins to telescope. The forks, supported by the two front wheels, are raised hydraulically to lift the pallet. The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>

<p>Caterpillar forklifts are notoriously powerful. A parking brake (or mechanism) which may be a part of, or include the service brake(s), shall be provided and be capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 10% grade, whichever is the lesser. The innovative 3-phase motors in our electric forklifts combine powerful performance with minimal consumption of power.</p>
<p>This decreased load center is specified, recognizing that loads may be handled which have a higher density and therefore, shorter load center than the truck rating. Although with a small share in electric forklifts, lithium battery forklifts are growing rapidly with its sales volume in 2018 expected to double that in 2017. These rough terrain forklifts are able to operate in a variety of terrains with the optional 4 four-wheel drive and standard differential lock.</p>
