<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution.

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse.

Adoption of forklifts for lifting various types of materials, such as steel, wood, and mortar, by the construction industry to transfer heavy goods and reduce mishandling is driving industry growth.</p>
