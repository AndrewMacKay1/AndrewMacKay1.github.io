A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>You can see how the project goes and determine if you need to add one to your fleet, or if you can simply rent one from time to time. With their 2.4 m long forks, these low level order pickers are able to pick up as many as three pallets weighing up to 2.5 t.
