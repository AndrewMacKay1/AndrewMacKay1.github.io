Class V forklifts are rider fork trucks, with cabs and seated controls, internal combustion engines, and pneumatic tires. We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks. If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>
