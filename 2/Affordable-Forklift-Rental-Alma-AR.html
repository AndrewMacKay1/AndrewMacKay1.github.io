<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>RT forklifts are ideal for smaller jobsites, due to it's lower cost and maneuverability. Constructed to fit in narrow aisle spaces, a forklift maneuvers around crowded warehouses with ease. Therefore, no matter what the specific characteristics are of the individual pallet jack, it is still one of the most versatile and usable pieces of moving equipment for any business to have readily available for everyday use.</p>
<h2>WI Lift, IL Material Handling, Ellis Systems, Wolter Power Alma </h2>
<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments.

<h2>Pallet Truck Parts Alma</h2>
<p>These lift trucks are meant to operate in narrow aisles and are best for storing and retrieving pallets in racks. The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet. These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck. These forklifts feature a simple, cost-effective Tier 4 Final solution.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, you may find that a pallet jack is the best fit for your warehouse or product. These trucks like most of our products come up with the option of customization. Wrap orders before loading on trucks. In North America, reach trucks are typically stand up trucks. If the operator is riding in the order picking truck, they wear a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls.</p>
<p>Our fleet of forklifts are from well-known manufacturers like Komatsu, Genie, Toyota, and Lull. Having rust free suspension components when we go to install a lift, makes for a smooth transition from stock to lifted.

Toyota order pickers offers intuitive controls and features like ergonomic control handles, panoramic views, and padded platforms, to help operators do more with less effort.</p>

Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements. The standard course is intended to last for 5 days but for an experienced Forklift Truck Operator who holds a valid or recently expired certificate, a 3 day refresher can be attended.</p>

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
