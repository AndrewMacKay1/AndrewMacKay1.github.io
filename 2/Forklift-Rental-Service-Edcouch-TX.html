<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment.

If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
