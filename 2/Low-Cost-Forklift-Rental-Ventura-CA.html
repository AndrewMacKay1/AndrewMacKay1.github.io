<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced â€” meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>

The new products offer advances in efficiency technology with their optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking.</p>
