We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler. Adding to this, growth in sectors such as retail, FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) and pharmaceutical industries will boost the Pallet Trucks demand, especially in developing parts of the globe.</p>

<h3>How To Choose The Right Pallet Jack For The Job Waupun WI 53963</h3>
<p>With the rise in popularity of the telehandler, the rough-terrain (RT) forklift has become the lower-cost, more-maneuverable alternative on construction sites. That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>
<p>The counterweight on these trucks juts out much further than the next size down, resulting in a longer truck. Use only approved industrial trucks in hazardous locations. Advancements in fuel technologies has led to a proliferation of different fuel types for standard similar sized forklifts including LPG, CNG and battery electric units. A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>
