<h2>Forklift Safety Tips Arnold </h2>
<p>Toyota provides complete safety training for forklifts. OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer.

<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades.
