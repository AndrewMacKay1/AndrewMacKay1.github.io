<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses. Their manoeuvrability, tires and traction force make them very popular in industries where very heavy loads must be transported on rough or unpaved grounds.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
