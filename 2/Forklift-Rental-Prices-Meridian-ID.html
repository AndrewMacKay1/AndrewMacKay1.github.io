<p>Class 3: Electric Motor Hand or Hand-Rider Trucks. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. Rough terrain forklifts are perfect for moving heavy loads across rugged terrains. Also known as stand-on and electric riders, standup trucks are easier to maneuver than sit-downs and can work in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Including heavy-duty shop presses, steel lever bars, pole jacks, reel jacks, screw jacks, and several types of ratchet jacks, we offer a full line of mechanical jacks capable of lifting up to 75 tons.
