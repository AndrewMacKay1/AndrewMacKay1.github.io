One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle. Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
