Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable.

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.
