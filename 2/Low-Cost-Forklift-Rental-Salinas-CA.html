Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Linde reach trucks are equipped with such features as adjustable steering. These are just the most common types of forklift trucks. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model. Descriptive, task-oriented names (such as side loader, high-lift pallet” forklift) aside, forklifts are often referred to in more colloquial terms.</p>
